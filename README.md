# MEGA BERTRAND RUSSELL

** INACTIVE BECAUSE IT WAS JOKE **

A spoof of a game YetiBowl by [Tag Creative Studio](http://tagcreativestudio.com/)

The game follows a simple man as he tries to climb the mountain of existence. Can he reach the summit before Bertrand pummels him with the truth of existence? Does it matter either way?

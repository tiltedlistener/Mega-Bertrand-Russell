# MEGA BERTRAND RUSSELL

 [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/visionmedia/jade/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/jade)

A spoof of a game YetiBowl by Tag Creative Studio - http://tagcreativestudio.com/

The game follows a simple man as he tries to climb the mountain of existence. Can he reach the summit before Bertrand pummels him with the truth of existence? Does it matter either way?
